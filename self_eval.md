# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    - I am most proud of how quickly I was able to solve the final practice exercise and how comfortable with the process, the outcomes, and the expectations I was.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
    - Methods allow us to alter, examine, and work with data, either with standard methods or those we create for specific tasks, with tremendous ease and efficiency. using methods, we can reduce minutes or hours of work into a few keystrokes or create new shortcuts which allow us to repeatably and reliably perform a new task that needs doing.
